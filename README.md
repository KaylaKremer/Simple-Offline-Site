An OFFLINE gardener's app to take with you outside. Easily look up information on when, where, and how to plant.

This is a WIP mock-up app idea I had while learning about service workers. I thought an offline gardening/farming app would be useful to have for those who might not have great connection while planting outside.

I will periodically try to update this as I learn more about mobile web development. 

I used the demo from the CSS-Tricks article below as a basis for my offline app.
